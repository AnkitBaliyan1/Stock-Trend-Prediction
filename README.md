# Stock Price Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Overview

The Stock Price Prediction Using Neural Networks project is a work-in-progress, utilizing Python and neural networks to predict stock prices. This project aims to develop a robust and accurate stock price prediction model to help investors make informed decisions. While the project is currently incomplete due to hardware limitations, it showcases the potential of neural networks in forecasting financial markets.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Neural Network Model**: Utilize a neural network architecture to learn patterns and trends in historical stock price data.

- **Stock Price Forecasting**: Develop a predictive model to forecast future stock prices, helping investors make informed decisions.

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Integrate real-time stock market data to improve prediction accuracy.

## Use Cases (Planned)

- **Investment Decision Support**: Assist investors in making data-driven decisions based on stock price forecasts.

- **Risk Management**: Help users manage and mitigate risks associated with stock market investments.

- **Financial Analysis**: Provide insights into market trends and patterns for financial analysis.

## Contributions (Planned)

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to contribute by enhancing the model, adding new features, or improving existing ones.
